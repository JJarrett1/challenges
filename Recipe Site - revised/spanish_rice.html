      <h1>Ingredients</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil (can use up to 1/4 cup)</li>
        <li>1 onion, finely chopped (about 1 cup)</li>
        <li>1 garlic clove, minced (about 1 teaspoon)</li>
        <li>2 cups of medium or long-grain white rice</li>
        <li>
          3 cups chicken stock (or vegetable stock for vegetarian version)
        </li>
        <li>
          1 heaping tablespoon tomato paste or 1 cup of diced fresh or cooked
          tomatoes, strained
        </li>
        <li>Pinch of dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      </ul>

      <h1>Method</h1>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <h2>Brown the rice:</h2>
          <p>
            Heat olive oil in large skillet on medium/high heat. Add the rice
            and stir it so that the rice is lightly coated with the oil. Cook on
            medium high heat, stirring often, until much of the rice has
            browned.
          </p>
        </li>
        

        <li>
          <h2>Add onion, garlic:</h2>
          <p>
            Add the onion and cook, stirring frequently another 3 minutes, until
            the onions begin to soften. Add the garlic and cook until the onions
            are translucent and softened, about a minute more. Combine broth,
            tomato, oregano, salt, and browned rice and onions: To save time you
            can bring the stock to a simmer in a separate saucepan, with the
            tomato, oregano, and salt.
          </p>
        </li>
        

        <li>
          <h2>Combine the rice and broth mixture:</h2>
          <p>
            Add the browned rice to the simmering broth (or broth to the rice,
            depending on which pan has a cover). Or you can skip the simmering
            step and just add the broth and tomatoes to the rice.
          </p>
        </li>
       

        <li>
          <h2>Simmer, cover, cook until the rice has absorbed the stock:</h2>
          <p>
            Bring everything to a simmer, cover the pot and lower the heat to
            barely maintain a low simmer. Cook for 15-25 minutes, depending on
            the type of rice and the instructions on the rice package. Remove
            from heat and let sit for 5 minutes.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h2>Serve:</h2>
          <p>Fluff with a fork or spoon to serve.</p>
        </li>
      
      </ol>
