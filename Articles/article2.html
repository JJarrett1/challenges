            <h2>Log4Shell</h2>
            <p>Log4Shell, an internet vulnerability that affects millions of computers, involves an obscure but nearly
                ubiquitous piece of software, Log4j. The software is used to record all manner of activities that go on
                under the hood in a wide range of computer systems.
                Jen Easterly, director of the U.S. Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency, called Log4Shell the
                most serious vulnerability she's seen in her career. There have already been hundreds of thousands,
                perhaps millions, of attempts to exploit the vulnerability.
                So what is this humble piece of internet infrastructure, how can hackers exploit it and what kind of
                mayhem could ensue?
            </p>

            <h2>What does Log4j do?</h2>
            <p>Log4j records events—errors and routine system operations—and communicates diagnostic messages about them
                to system administrators and users. It's open-source software provided by the Apache Software
                Foundation.</p>
            <p>A common example of Log4j at work is when you type in or click on a bad web link and get a 404 error
                message. The web server running the domain of the web link you tried to get to tells you that there's no
                such webpage. It also records that event in a log for the server's system administrators using Log4j.
            </p>
            <p>Similar diagnostic messages are used throughout software applications. For example, in the online game
                Minecraft, Log4j is used by the server to log activity like total memory used and user commands typed
                into the console.

            <h2>How does Log4Shell work?</h2>
            <p>Log4Shell works by abusing a feature in Log4j that allows users to specify custom code for formatting a
                log message. This feature allows Log4j to, for example, log not only the username associated with each
                attempt to log in to the server but also the person's real name, if a separate server holds a directory
                linking user names and real names. To do so, the Log4j server has to communicate with the server holding
                the real names.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, this kind of code can be used for more than just formatting log messages. Log4j allows
                third-party servers to submit software code that can perform all kinds of actions on the targeted
                computer. This opens the door for nefarious activities such as stealing sensitive information, taking
                control of the targeted system and slipping malicious content to other users communicating with the
                affected server.</p>
            <p> It is relatively simple to exploit Log4Shell. I was able to reproduce the problem in my copy of Ghidra,
                a reverse-engineering framework for security researchers, in just a couple of minutes. There is a very
                low bar for using this exploit, which means a wider range of people with malicious intent can use it.
            </p>

            <h2>Log4j is everywhere</h2>
            <p>One of the major concerns about Log4Shell is Log4j's position in the software ecosystem. Logging is a
                fundamental feature of most software, which makes Log4j very widespread. In addition to popular games
                like Minecraft, it's used in cloud services like Apple iCloud and Amazon Web Services, as well as a wide
                range of programs from software development tools to security tools.
            </p>
            <p> This means hackers have a large menu of targets to choose from: home users, service providers, source
                code developers and even security researchers. So while big companies like Amazon can quickly patch
                their web services to prevent hackers from exploiting them, there are many more organizations that will
                take longer to patch their systems, and some that might not even know they need to.
