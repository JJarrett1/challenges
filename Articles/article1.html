            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Christmas is indeed the most wonderful time of the year for many Jamaicans.
                It's the time when the meat options are plenty, and loved ones convene for dinner
                - at the larger, sometimes more comfy - home of a relative.For those who opt-out of
                a home-cooked meal, there's always a neighbour or other gathering elsewhere. Fact is
                everyone is dining and usually happy.Things have changed somewhat this year, so we urge
                you to practise safety protocols, such as socially distant dining, and washing and/or
                sanitising the hands often while preparing meals and before and after dining.

            <h2>Some Family Traditions</h2>
            <p>
            <ol>
                <li>As natural creatives, many Jamaican children would rub together styrofoam bits from the
                    packaging of new appliances or the like to make 'snow'. Christmas in Jamaica is a season of
                    new furniture and appliances, so there's nary a shortage of styrofoam.</li>
                <li>The young 'uns stock up on
                    'clappas' and fire rockets for Christmas Day, New Year's Eve, New Year's Day merriment, and the days
                    leading up to the hallmark holidays.day</li>
                <li>Mothers and/or grandmothers stock up on new everything:
                    New 'runners'/'dusters' for the furniture, new pyjama sets, new figurines, new
                    rugs/mats...everything
                    has to be new!</li>
                <li>The official Christmas cleaning would take place on or just before Christmas Eve.You'll
                    know it's time when you see new drapes/curtains, newly wrapped sofas, or for those who can, an
                    interior
                    decorator transforming the space.</li>
                <li>Piping <em>hot chocolate tea</em> with the oil floating on top is the ultimate
                    Christmas breakfast beverage.This is usually served with the traditional Christmas breakfast that
                    includes
                    ackee and saltfish, callaloo and ham, ackee and corned pork and/or fried/boiled dumplings and
                    produce.</li>
                <li>Everyone
                    packs up and heads to the countryside to visit the grandparents' or to gather for the annual
                    unofficial family reunion.
                </li>
                <li>Once you see the lights and decorations strung in the plazas, you know it's Christmastime in
                    Kingston.Many Jamaicans
                    grade the plazas on best presentations, while others view it as a spectacle, made to bring about
                    Christmas cheer.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Other traditions</h2>
            <p>
            <ol start="8">
                <li>For Kingstonians, a shopping spree at Tropical, Mall, Village or Springs Plazas is a pastime turned
                    tradition.</li>
                <li>Grand Market shopping on Christmas Eve is an event like no other! You find the nearest market or
                    head to Half-Way-Tree and walk the streets in search of bargains before - and many times, after -
                    midnight.</li>
                <li>Put out the poinsettias. Traditionally, poinsettias are purchased to either decorate the home or
                    office or to gift loved ones.</li>
                <li>All the dominoes, ludo boards and video games come out for an entire day of games and activities
                    among friends and loved ones.</li>
                <li>Whether or not you're at grandma's house, the first church service on Christmas Day is a MUST!</li>
                <li>You know it's Christmas in Jamaica if there's a trip to LP Azar - or the like - to purchase
                    decorations, home accessories or to secure the finest fabric that a family member or seamstress will
                    spin into custom drapes and curtains just for the season.</li>
            </ol>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="setion4" class="content">
            <h2>And Finally...</h2>
            <p>
            <ol start="14">
                <li>There is a seemingly unending supply of sorrel, soursop juice, a Grace Fruit Punch mix - sometimes
                    spiked with rum. There's also ginger beer, egg nog or sometimes, carrot juice.</li>
                <li>Jonkunnu parade! Whenever these guys come around it's 'all hell bruck loose'.</li>
            </ol>
            And in most cases, the children looking on in despair are either terrified or excited to see the procession.
            Their arrival is usually preceded by Afrocentric drumming and vividly colourful costumes.
