        <li>1 cup (8oz/225g) granulated sugar</li>

        <li>grated zest and juice of 1 lemon</li>

      <h1>Instructions</h1>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).</li>
        <li>
          In a small bowl mix together the cookie crumbs and melted butter.
          Press into a 9-inch springform tin. Place in the fridge to chill.
        </li>
        <li>
          Using a stand mixer or an electric hand mixer, whisk the cream cheese
          and sugar together on high speed until smooth and there are no lumps.
        </li>
        <li>Add in the vanilla, lemon zest, and juice.</li>
        <li>
          Slowly add in the eggs one at a time until fully blended. At this
          point, your mix should be nice and airy from all the mixing.
        </li>
        <li>Add in the flour and mix until combined.</li>
        <li>
          Bake for about 70 - 80 minutes. You will know when it is done when
          there will still be a slight jiggle in the middle. Set aside to cool.
          TIP: Place a baking pan with hot water on the shelf below the
          cheesecake as it bakes. This will help To avoid a cracked cheesecake.
        </li>
        <li>
          While still in the tin place the cheesecake in the fridge to chill for
          a minimum of 5 hours but preferably overnight. It needs a few hours to
          firm up. Serve with some stewed fruit, whipped cream, or ice-cream on
          top. Store in the fridge for up to 4 days. It also freezes very well
          for up to 4 weeks.
